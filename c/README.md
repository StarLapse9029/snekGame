## Snake Game Made in C with SDL2

### TODO:

#### -Add more colors
#### -~Maybe~ Visual effects
#### -Increase Difficulty with score
#### -Add Highscores
#### -Add makefile


### Compile with:

```bash
gcc main.c -o main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
```

### Challenge for my future self ~you hate me already~:
- Emulate classes with structs and function pointers.
- Use better names.
- Make code more readable.
- Separate code into multiple source files.
